<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p><b>rubygem-instantcache</b> provides the <a
href="InstantCache.html">InstantCache</a> module, a mixin which has
accessors that allow you to declare ‘instance variables’ that are
actually stored in a memcached cluster rather than local memory.</p>

<h2>GLOSSARY:</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>blob := blug</p>
</li><li>
<p><b><em>blob</em></b>, <b><em>blob object</em></b>, or <b><em>blob
instance</em></b>: An instrumented <a
href="InstantCache/Blob.html">InstantCache::Blob</a> or <a
href="InstantCache/Counter.html">InstantCache::Counter</a> object that has
been instantiated and stored in an <em>instance variable</em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><b><em>cached value</em></b>: The value actually stored in the memcached
cluster.</p>
</li><li>
<p><b><em>cache</em></b> (or <b><em>cached</em></b>) <b><em>variable</em></b>:
an instance variable declared with one of the
<tt>memcached_<em>xxx</em></tt> declarators and holding a <em>blob
instance</em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><b><em>cell</em></b> or <b><em>cache cell</em></b>: The named location in
the memcached cluster where a <em>cached value</em> is stored.</p>
</li><li>
<p><b><em>instance variable</em></b>: This has its canonical meaning: a named
cell local to an object.  <em>Blob objects</em> are stored in <em>instance
variables</em> to form <em>cached variables</em>.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>FEATURES:</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Provides <tt>memcached_reader</tt>, <tt>memcached_accessor</tt>, and
<tt>memcached_counter</tt> accessor declarations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cached variables declared with <tt>memcached_counter</tt> are restricted to
integer values, and are incrementable/decrementable atomically.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cached variables may be shared, using cells in memcache named by the user,
or may be private, with opaque names unique to each instance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cached variables may be locked and unlocked for atomic operations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If an instance variable is inadvertently overwritten, a new connexion to
the cached value will be created (a new blob object will be instantiated)
the next time one of InstantCache’s methods is used to access it.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>CAVEATS AND WARNINGS</h2>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="InstantCache.html">InstantCache</a> works by storing a
specially-instrumented object in the actual instance variable.  References
from within the class to an instance variable declared as a cached variable
should use the “<tt>self.</tt>” prefix (<em>e.g.</em>,
<tt>self.ivar</tt>) or the blob object’s methods directly (<em>e.g.</em>,
<tt>@ivar.get</tt> or <tt>@ivar.set(17)</tt>).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Direct assignment to an instance variable (<em>e.g.</em>, <tt>@ivar =
17</tt>) will lose the instrumented object and result in a new one being
created.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>KNOWN PROBLEMS:</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>If an cached variable is locked, and is then re-instantiated/reconnected,
the variable will <b>remain</b> locked and cannot be unlocked.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Multiple references to a cached variable can get out of sync, leading to
confusion if they are updated independently.  That is,</p>

<pre>class Foo
  include InstantCache
  memcached_accessor(:ivar)
end

f = Foo.new
f.ivar = [1,2,3]
copy = f.ivar
f.ivar = 17
copy
=&gt; [1,2,3]
f.ivar
=&gt; 17
copy &lt;&lt; 4
=&gt; [1,2,3,4]
f.ivar
=&gt; [1,2,3,4]</pre>
</li></ul>

<h2>SYNOPSIS:</h2>

<pre>require 'memcache'
require 'instantcache'

class Foo
  include InstantCache
  memcached_counter(:c1)          # defaults to 0 if not already existant
  memcached_accessor(InstantCache::PRIVATE, :private_a1)

  def bar
    @c1.increment
    self.c1_increment
    self.decrement(2)
  end
end

InstantCache.cache_object = MemCache.new('127.0.0.1:11211')
foo = Foo.new
foo.c1 = 0
=&gt; 0
foo.private_a1 = nil
=&gt; nil
foo.bar
=&gt; 0                              # cell was incremented and then decremented
foo.bar = 21
=&gt; 21
foo.bar
=&gt; 21
foo.bar_increment(2)
=&gt; 23
foo.bar_destroy!
=&gt; nil
foo.bar
InstantCache::Destroyed: attempt to access destroyed variable</pre>
