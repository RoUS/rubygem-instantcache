o Setting default values and adding finalisers is all well and good
  when the variables are only used by a single entity -- but not so
  hot when they're actually shared.  You don't want to
  initialise-to-default an existing variable someone else was using
  before you joined, and you don't want to delete a shared element
  from the cache just because *you're* exiting.  Adding controls for
  these needs to be a fairly high priority for this package to be
  truly useful..
o Should private variables be allowed to have user-set names?
  [For now, no.]
o Need to test true sharing, in which cell names are *not* necessarily
  unique to each test, and may be left around between them
